# MA64
Minecraft Architecture 64

**!! this has nothing to do with vienna nor some random pair of glassses !!**

## What is MA64
MA64 is an attempt to be an CPU architecture run on the Minecraft Game. The emulator will then of course be written in Java (duh). As indicated by the name MA64 is a 64-Bit architecture and should be comparable with x86 and ARM. So it should be modern and simple.
